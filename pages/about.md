Hey! I’m Will and currently I’m a graduate Computer Science student at HCMUS. I’m passionate about coding and have experience in developing mobile projects. Besides that, I also love to teach Python and share my knowledge with others.

When I’m not programming, I like to unwind by singing or playing the piano or guitar. I find that music is a great way to express myself and it helps me to recharge my batteries.

I'm excited to share my experiences and insights with you through this blog. So, welcome to my personal IT blog, where I’ll be writing about all things tech and beyond. I hope you find the content here informative and engaging.
